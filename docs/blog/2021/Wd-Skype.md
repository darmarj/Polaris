## Architecture

Material for MkDocs uses [lunr] together with [lunr-languages] to implement
its client-side search capabilities. When a documentation page is loaded and
JavaScript is available, the search index as generated by the
[built-in search plugin] during the build process is requested from the
server:

``` ts
const index$ = document.forms.namedItem("search")
  ? __search?.index || requestJSON<SearchIndex>(
    new URL("search/search_index.json", config.base)
  )
  : NEVER
```

### Benchmarks

We conducted two benchmarks – one with the documentation of Material for MkDocs
itself, and one with a very massive corpus of Markdown files with more than
800,000 words – a size most documentation projects will likely never
reach:
