Two weeks ago, Material for MkDocs Insiders shipped a brand new search plugin,
yielding massive improvements in usability, but also in speed and size of the
search index. Interestingly, as discussed in the previous blog article, we only
scratched the surface of what's now possible. This release brings some useful
features that enhance the writing experience, allowing for more fine-grained
control of what pages, sections and blocks of a Markdown file should be indexed
by the built-in search functionality.

## [Search: better, faster, smaller]

__This is the story of how we managed to completely rebuild client-side search,
delivering a significantly better user experience while making it faster and
smaller at the same time.__

The search of Material for MkDocs is by far one of its best and most-loved
assets: multilingual, offline-capable, and most importantly: _all client-side_.
It provides a solution to empower the users of your documentation to find what
they're searching for instantly without the headache of managing additional
servers. However, even though several iterations have been made, there's still
some room for improvement, which is why we rebuilt the search plugin and
integration from the ground up. This article shines some light on the internals
of the new search, why it's much more powerful than the previous version, and
what's about to come.
